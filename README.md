## Project Title:

Contributions API

## Project Description:

This is a sample API that provides information on the Senate race in the 2014 Georgia General Election. It was developed to demonstrate the ability to use two seperate third-party API's to consolidate and process data. The data is sourced from the Google Civic Information API and the Maplight API. This was also an exercise to demonstrate the ability to set up a basic server, employ code tests, utilize promise-chaining, and work with async/await.
